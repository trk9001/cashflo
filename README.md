# CashFlo

CashFlo is currently in development. To view its status, take a look at the
*Projects* tab, check out the *milestones*, or sneak into the *develop* branch
to take a peek. If they exist, that is. Also, while CashFlo remains unreleased,
the default branch may be set to *develop*, so yeah, that.

## Motivation

Before I started getting paid, I lived off my parent-provided pocket money, and
was an all-round cheapskate. After I started getting paid, I began to use my
own money for most things. But it turns out that I spend a lot, and I'm not
even aware of where and how. So I turned to budgeting and personal-finance
solutions and tried a few on the market. I didn't like any of them.

All of that equals motivation to build my own solution. Thus, CashFlo.

## Contribution

CashFlo is currently in development. Déjà vu right there. Anyway, please check
out the issues and see if you can help out in any way. If you can, let me know
with a comment. You can also go through the code (if you're feeling *really* generous), and if
you find a bug or error or just disagree with something, open a new issue. I'll
try to respond as soon as I possibly can.
